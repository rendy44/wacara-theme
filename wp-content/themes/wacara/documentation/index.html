    <h3 id="events"><strong>D) The Events</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
    <p>When you are creating an event, there are bunch of configurations you can play with. Basically, they are separated into three different metaboxes,
        <strong>Detail</strong>, <strong>Schedule</strong>, and <strong>Design</strong>.</p>
    <h4 id="metabox-detail"><strong>D.1) Detail</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
    <p>In this metabox we will be separate into three different tabs, <strong>General</strong>,
        <strong>Rules</strong>, and <strong>Fields</strong>.</p>
    <h5 id="detail-general"><strong>D.1.1) General</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h5>
    <p>This tab contains few fields that will be explained below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Date start</strong>, is field to configure when the event will be started. This field also has responsibility to the countdown in header section.
            <img src="assets/images/countdown.jpg" alt="">
            <p><small><i>Countdown section in header.</i></small></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Single day</strong>, as its name, whether we want to create an event that will be held in one day or multiple day. If
            <strong>Single day</strong> is checked, it will reproduce another field which is called
            <strong>Time end</strong>. The field is used to save information when the event will be ended.
            In another hand, if <strong>Single day</strong> is not checked, it will also reproduce a field called
            <strong>Date end</strong>. it's opposite from
            <strong>Date start</strong>, which is to save the date end time of when the event will be ended.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="detail-rules"><strong>D.1.2) Rules</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h5>
    <p>This tab only contains one field, that is
        <strong>Allow register</strong>, if you check this option you will allow the user to register to your event. In another hand, if you uncheck this option you will not allow user to register to your event. This option will useful if you are organizing free public event which does not require any registration.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/images/no-registration.jpg" alt="">
    <p><small><i>Registration section if the event does not allow registration.</i></small></p>

    <h5 id="detail-fields"><strong>D.1.3) Fields</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h5>
    <p>In this tab you can configure the fields of your event's registration form.</p>
    <p>Basically, every field has three options, whether include the field on the registration form or not, set the field as mandatory, and set the label of the field. But there are two fields that you can not exclude the field and its mandatory function, they are
        <strong>Email</strong> and <strong>Name</strong>.</p>
    <h4 id="metabox-schedule"><strong>D.2) Schedule</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
    <p>You can display the information of the event's rundown from the start until the finish. You can add as many timeline as you desire, and each timeline has three fields, they are
        <strong>Period</strong>, <strong>Title</strong>, and <strong>Content</strong>.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/timeline.jpg" alt="">
    <p><small></small></p>
    <hr>

    <h3 id="credits"><strong>E) Sources and Credits</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

    <p>I've used the following images, icons or other files as listed.

    <ul>
        <li>File name from file author</li>
        <li>File name from file author</li>
        <li>File name from file author</li>
        <li>File name from file author</li>
    </ul>

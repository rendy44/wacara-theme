    <h3 id="events"><strong>D) The Events</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
    <p>When you are creating an event, there are bunch of configurations you can play with. Basically, they are separated into three different metaboxes,
        <strong>Detail</strong>, <strong>Schedule</strong>, and <strong>Design</strong>.</p>

    <h4 id="metabox-detail"><strong>D.1) Detail</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
    <p>In this metabox we will separate into three different tabs, <strong>General</strong>,
        <strong>Rules</strong>, and <strong>Fields</strong>.</p>
    <h5 id="detail-general"><strong>D.1.1) General</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h5>
    <p>This tab contains few fields that will be explained below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Date start</strong>, is field to configure when the event will be started. This field also has responsibility to the countdown in header section.
            <img src="assets/images/countdown.jpg" alt="">
            <p><small><i>Countdown section in header.</i></small></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Single day</strong>, as its name, whether we want to create an event that will be held in one day or multiple day. If
            <strong>Single day</strong> is checked, it will reproduce another field which is called
            <strong>Time end</strong>. The field is used to save information when the event will be ended.
            In another hand, if <strong>Single day</strong> is not checked, it will also reproduce a field called
            <strong>Date end</strong>. it's opposite from
            <strong>Date start</strong>, which is to save the date end time of when the event will be ended.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="detail-rules"><strong>D.1.2) Rules</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h5>
    <p>This tab only contains one main field, that is
        <strong>Allow register</strong>, if you check this option you will allow the user to register to your event. In another hand, if you uncheck this option you will not allow user to register to your event. This option will useful if you are organizing free public event which does not require any registration.
        Moreover, if you activate the <i>Allow register</i>, it will produce one more field that's called
        <strong>Limit register</strong>.
        Just like its name, the field will add more flexibility to the event whether you want to create an event with limited seats or limited registration time. Currently we can limit the registration by two fields,
        <strong>By registrant</strong>, and <strong>By date</strong>.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/images/no-registration.jpg" alt="">
    <p><small><i>Registration section if the event does not allow registration.</i></small></p>
    <h5 id="detail-fields"><strong>D.1.3) Fields</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h5>
    <p>In this tab you can configure the fields of your event's registration form.</p>
    <p>Basically, every field has three options, whether include the field on the registration form or not, set the field as mandatory, and set the label of the field. But there are two fields that you can not exclude the field and its mandatory function, they are
        <strong>Email</strong> and <strong>Name</strong>.</p>
    <hr/>

    <h4 id="metabox-schedule"><strong>D.2) Schedule</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
    <p>You can display the information of the event's rundown from the start until the finish. You can add as many timeline as you desire, and each timeline has three fields, they are
        <strong>Period</strong>, <strong>Title</strong>, and <strong>Content</strong>.</p>

    <h4 id="metabox-design"><strong>D.3) Design</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
    <p>This metabox has eight different tabs, mostly they are representing the layout of the event's landing page. Those tabs are
        <strong>General</strong>, <strong>About section</strong>, <strong>Speakers section</strong>,
        <strong>Venue section</strong>, <strong>Gallery section</strong>, <strong>Sponsors section</strong>,
        <strong>Schedule section</strong>, and <strong>Pricing section</strong>.</p>
    <h5 id="design-general"><strong>D.3.1) General</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h5>
    <p>This tab contains four fields that will be explained below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Section order</strong>, this means you an adjust the order of sections in your event's landing page. You can even drop not desired section. But keep in mind, header will always remain in the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Main logo</strong>, you can adjust the logo for each event. and if you leave the field empty your event will use logo of your site which is you can set it from options.
